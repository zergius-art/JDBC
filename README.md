# jdbc-sql-injection
a simple project to show how to prevent SQL Injection by using PreparedStatement in JDBC

This program work with local DB so you can't run it
It have only one metod Main in wich all magic happens
It's a lot information about SQL Injection over the Internet so I wouldn't explain

This is my first project on GitHub so if you have any recommendations - I will accept them with pleasure :)
